> **Doctrine**: No Human In The Loop (NHITL) | 100% Upstream Bun v1.4.4+ & Rust 2024

## Autonomous NHITL Agent & Context / Token Optimization Best Practices (24/7 Operations)

### 1. Context Window & Token Optimization

- **High-Precision Targeting**: Never dump large raw files into the model context. Use exact byte/line range reads or AST/symbol lookups.
- **Zero-Polling Reactive Wakeup**: When launching background tasks or subagents, do not poll in loops. Yield execution immediately and wait for reactive system events.
- **Compact & High Information Density**: Output concise, fact-based reports with clickable markdown file links (`[file.ext](file:///path/to/file)`). Do not narrate obvious actions.
- **Strict Zero-Emoji Policy**: Zero emojis in all code, comments, commit messages, PRs, logs, and agent communications.

### 2. Autonomous Execution (NHITL - No Human In The Loop)

- **Continuous Grind & Auto-Goal**: Independently identify objectives, resolve compile errors, apply fixes, format (`bun fmt`), lint (`bun lint`), typecheck (`bun check`), test (`bun test` / `cargo test`), commit, and push.
- **Pure Tech Stack**: 100% Upstream Bun v1.4.4+, Rust 2024, Python uv v0.13.7+, Go 1.27+. Zero Node.js, npm, yarn, or pnpm.
- **Strict Isolation & Safe Execution**: Heavy Rust builds run on vps (12 cores) with sccache under shared lock; web and fast tests run on bunos or local Bun.
